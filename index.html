        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Boil the pasta. 
          Meanwhile, 
          fry pancetta in oil in a frying pan for a few mins             until golden and crisp. Add garlic, fry for 1 min,             then turn off the heat. Briefly whisk egg and 
       yolkswith most of the parmesan and some seasoning.<br>
            <br>
       <strong>Step 2:</strong> Drain pasta, reserving a 
         little of 
         the cooking water. Add eggs and a tbsp of cooking              water, then mix until pasta is coated and creamy. 
         The heat from the pasta will gently cook the sauce. 
        Stir in the pancetta and garlic then serve, topped 
        with the remaining parmesan.

         <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Scrape the new potatoes 
         or leave the skins on, if you prefer. Cut them into 
         thick slices.<br>
             <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat the extra-virgin olive            oil in a large frying pan, add the potatoes and               stew gently, partially covered, for 30 mins,                  stirring occasionally until the potatoes are                  softened. Strain the potatoes and onion through a             colander into a large bowl (set the strained oil              aside).<br>
              <br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> 
             Beat the eggs separately, then stir into the                 potatoes with the parsley and plenty of salt.                 Heat a little of the strained oil in a smaller 
            pan.<br>
               <br>
         <strong>Step 4:</strong> Tip everything into                     the pan and cook on a moderate heat, using a                 spatula to shape the omelette into a cushion.<br>
               <br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> When almost set, invert on a             plate and slide back into the pan and cook a few              more minutes.<br>
               <br>
        <strong>Step 6:</strong>Invert twice more, cooking             the omelette briefly each time and pressing the               edges to keep the cushion shape. Slide on to a                plate and cool for 10 mins before serving.<br>

             </tbody>
         </table>

         <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pour the tamari into a              large dish and stir in the curry powder, cumin,                garlic and honey. Mix well. Slice the chicken                 breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets in             total, then add to the marinade and mix well to               coat. Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr,              or overnight, to allow the flavours to penetrate             the chicken.<br>
             <br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, mix the peanut               butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1                tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce. When ready              to cook the chicken, wipe a large non-stick                   frying pan with a little oil. Add the chicken and             cook, covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a                   medium heat, turning the fillets over for the                last min, until cooked but still moist. Set aside,             covered, to rest for a few mins.<br>
             <br>
       <strong>Step 3:</strong> 
           While the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges             with the cucumber, shallot, coriander and                     pomegranate, and pile onto plates. Spoon over a                little sauce. Slice the chicken, pile on top of               the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce. Eat             while the chicken is still warm..<br>
